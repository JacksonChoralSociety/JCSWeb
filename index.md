		We are an 80+ voice, non-auditioned ensemble of singers from Jackson and surrounding communities.
		Our members all share a love of choral music. Performance repertoire is varied and diverse, performing composers such as Monteverdi, Mozart, Gjeilo, Whitacre, as well as pop and Broadway selections.
